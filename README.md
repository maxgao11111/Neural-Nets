# Neural-Nets

This project contains different neural networks I have worked on, written in Python.

The file "functions.py" contains the non-linear functions such as sigmoid and tanh as well as various cost functions like cross-entropy.

As to date, I have created a feedforward neural network ("feedforward.py") and a recurrent neural network ("recurrent.py") without the use of machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow. The feedforward neural network also has L1 and L2 regularization implemented.

Currently, I am working on the back propagation behind convolutional neural networks and making my code more flexible, by coding the different layers as their own unique object types.

My ultimate goal is to learn how different types of neural networks work and the math behind them, and how to improve on current models.


System Requirements: numpy
